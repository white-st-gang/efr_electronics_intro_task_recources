# Introductory Task for Electronics Members



**Task: Design and Route an LED strip in Altium Designer**



**Timeframe:** 14 days



**Instructions:**

1. Download and Install Altium Designer - there is a free student version
2. Clone the GitHub Repo with the component library and design rules
3. Create a new Altium Project
4. Setup the project with the library and design rules
5. Design a schematic for an led strip that incorporates 2 different led colors
6. maximum design space: 7mm x 210 mm

supply voltage: 24V

The individual LEDs should have a minum brightness of 1000 mcd

make sure to take into account how hot each component will get and make sure that with an air temp of 35deg C the component does not go out of spec

Solderable connection

Rout the designed PCB:

number of layers: 2

leds should be evenly spaced in x and y directions

a different number of leds between the colors is ok

the two colors should be distributed evenly across the whole pcb

add your name and season to the pcb with silk screen

Do a design rules check at the end, make sure you don't have any violations



Extra Tipps:

Use Net Labels in the schematics

Part numbers and datasheets are in the component properties

Keep your schematics organised and documented with any calculations or important information from a datasheet

Adjust the component properties as needed to fit the specific needs of the project

Learn the keyboard shortcuts!

change between board layout, 2D, and 3D views with “1”, “2”, “3”

change the grid size when routing with “G”
