# Introductory Task for Electronics Members



**Task: Design and Route an LED strip in Altium Designer**



**Timeframe:** 14 days from receiving these instructions



**Instructions:**

1. Download and Install Altium Designer (Version: 25.8.1) - there is a free student version
2. Clone the GitHub Repo with the component library and design rules
3. Create a NEW git repo and push it to GitHub, make sure the repo is private!
4. Copy over only the 01 directory from Intro Task repo (including all subdirectories) to the newly created repo.
5. Replace "Max\_Mustermann" with your own name in the project template folder
6. Share the GitHub repo with your modle leader
7. Create a new Altium Project
8. Setup the project with the library and design rules
9. Design a schematic for an led strip that incorporates 2 different led colors. This LED strip will be used as an **Autonomous System Status Indicator (ASSI)** in the upcoming season.

   1. supply voltage: 24V
   2. make sure to take into account how hot each component will get and make sure that with an air temp of 35deg C the component does not go out of spec
   3. Solderable connection to the wire harness
   4. Refer to the FSG 2025 v1.1 rules for guidance on how bright the LEDs should be
   5. make sure the schematics complies without errors

10. Rout the designed PCB:

    1. maximum design space: 7mm x 210 mm
    2. number of layers: 2
    3. LEDs should be evenly spaced in x and y directions (a different number of LEDs between the colors is ok)
    4. Refer to the FSG 2025 v1.1 rules for guidance on component placement, allowed board shapes, and the allowed minimum illuminated surface.
    5. add your name and season to the PCB with silk screen
    6. Do a design rules check at the end, make sure you don't have any violations

11. Make sure to commit and push regularly



Extra Tipps:

1. Use Net Labels in the schematics
2. Part numbers and datasheets are in the component properties
3. Keep your schematics organized and documented with any calculations or important information from a datasheet
4. Adjust the component properties as needed to fit the specific needs of the project
5. Learn the keyboard shortcuts!

   1. change between board layout, 2D, and 3D views with “1”, “2”, “3”
   2. change the grid size when routing with “G”

6. Use a Git GUI if you do not have much Git experience, we use "Git Extensions" (https://gitextensions.github.io/) in the team

4. Your module leader



When done:

1. When you are finished with the above task, send your module leader a message and the link to your GitHub Repo
2. If it is clear that you have put in sufficient effort your module leader will get back to you and give you feedback
