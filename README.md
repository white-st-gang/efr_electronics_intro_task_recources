# Introductory Task for Electronics Members



**Task: Design and Route an LED strip in Altium Designer**



**Timeframe:** 14 days from receiving these instructions



**Instructions:**

1. Download and Install Altium Designer - there is a free student version
2. Clone the GitHub Repo with the component library and design rules
3. Create a NEW get repo and push it to GitHub, make sure the repo is private!
4. Add only the 01 directory from Intro Task repo and all subdirectories to the new repo.
5. Share the repo with your modle leader
6. Replace "Max_Mustermann" with your own name in the project template folder 
7. Create a new Altium Project
8. Setup the project with the library and design rules
9. Design a schematic for an led strip that incorporates 2 different led colors
10. maximum design space: 7mm x 210 mm
  a. supply voltage: 24V
  b. The individual LEDs should have a minum brightness of 1000 mcd
  c. make sure to take into account how hot each component will get and make sure that with an air temp of 35deg C the component does not go out of spec
  d. Solderable connection
  e. make sure the schematics complies without errors
11. Rout the designed PCB:
  a. number of layers: 2
  b. leds should be evenly spaced in x and y directions (a different number of leds between the colors is ok)
  c. the two colors should be distributed evenly across the whole pcb
  d. add your name and season to the pcb with silk screen
  d. Do a design rules check at the end, make sure you don't have any violations
12. Make sure to commit and push regularly 


Extra Tipps:
1. Use Net Labels in the schematics
2. Part numbers and datasheets are in the component properties
3. Keep your schematics organised and documented with any calculations or important information from a datasheet
4. Adjust the component properties as needed to fit the specific needs of the project
5. Learn the keyboard shortcuts!
  a. change between board layout, 2D, and 3D views with “1”, “2”, “3”
  b. change the grid size when routing with “G”
6. Use a Git GUI, we use "[Git Extensions]([url](https://gitextensions.github.io/))" in the team.

3. Your module leader


When done:
1. When you are finished with the above task, send your module leader a message and the link to your GitHub Repo
2. If it is clear that you have put in sufficient effort your module leader will get back to you and give you feedback
